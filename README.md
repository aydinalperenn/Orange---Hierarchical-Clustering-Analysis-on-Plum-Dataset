# Orange - Hierarchical Clustering Analysis on Plum Dataset

An Orange data mining project that applies hierarchical clustering to a custom Plum dataset containing multiple plum varieties, including green, purple, and loquat plums. The analysis specifically focuses on green and purple plums to examine their overlapping clusters in the Scatter Plot. The workflow computes pairwise distances, performs hierarchical grouping, and visualizes how certain feature similarities cause these two varieties to intersect in cluster space.
